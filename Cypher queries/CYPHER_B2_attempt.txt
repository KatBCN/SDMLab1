MATCH (conf:Conference), (a:Author)

ORDER BY authorCnt DESC LIMIT 10

WHERE size(conferenceEditions)>=4
RETURN author.name as Author, c.title as Conference, conferenceEditions, size(conferenceEditions) as EditionsParticipated

Another option using count instead of collect:


MATCH(conference:Conference)<-[:EDITION_OF]-(ce:conferenceEdition)<-[:PUBLISHED_IN]-(:Paper)<-[:WROTE]-(author:Author)
WITH count(distinct(ce.title)) as EditionsParticipated, author, conference
WHERE EditionsParticipated >= 4
RETURN author.name as Author, conference.title as Conference, EditionsParticipated
ORDER BY EditionsParticipated DESC


Another option - possibly less efficient:

MATCH (c:Conference)
CALL{
    WITH c
    MATCH (c)<-[ed:EDITION_OF]-(ce:conferenceEdition)<-[pub:PUBLISHED_IN]-(p:Paper)<-[wrote:WROTE]-(author:Author)
    WITH count(distinct(ce)) as numEditions, author.name as Author
    WHERE numEditions >= 4
    RETURN Author, numEditions
}

RETURN c.title as Conference, Author, numEditions as EditionsParticipated
ORDER BY EditionsParticipated DESC

Authors in a list per conference:

MATCH(conference:Conference)<-[:EDITION_OF]-(ce:conferenceEdition)<-[:PUBLISHED_IN]-(:Paper)<-[:WROTE]-(author:Author)
WITH count(distinct(ce.title)) as EditionsParticipated, author.name as Author, conference.title as Conference
WHERE EditionsParticipated>=4
RETURN Conference, collect (Author) as Community
